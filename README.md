# Project Title

NextDev Assigment

# Overview

I had 2 days to work on a challenging task by NextDev.
The task was to create an authentication process before the existing content of the app.

## Project timeline

Server Side:

1. Creating the server and the environment with MongoDB Atlas cluster
2. Structuring the database Schema with Mongoose
3. Creating the server routes with Express
4. Configuring the route controllers for the API requests
5. Implementing JWT authentication and hashing passwords
6. Testing all the requests with Postman

Client-Side :

1. New structure for React-Route-Dom with Protected Routes and authentication
2. Building UI for Login and New account using the app custom components
3. Configuring Redux store and Redux reduces for the state management
4. Syncing the backend with the front using Axios
5. Handling all the logic of the HTTP requests.
6. Delivering UX with successful feedbacks by Toasitfy and error messages to the UI
7. Improving Styling

## Wins and Blockers

Overall the task was a lot of fun to do, most of the work I already did in former projects to I felt the level is suitable for me. The feature is working and all the action items were accomplished.

1. Making the protected Routes with React DOM, was the first time I used it so I had to watch a short Youtube video to complete this task.
2. Using the custom made components for the Inputs, I had to first understand the logic of the components and had to do a lot of debugging until I figure the proper way to use them
3. Heroku deployment - server side run without any issue but the react build didn't work (this is reason for the several last commits)

## Things I would have done better if I had more time

1. I would improve styling and make better UX for handling user inputs errors
2. I would add more Validations for the user Inputs
